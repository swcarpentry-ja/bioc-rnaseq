Ensure that you have the most recent versions of R and RStudio installed on your computer.
For detailed instructions on how to do this, you can refer to the section "If you already have R and RStudio installed"
in the [Introduction to R](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/bioc-intro/#r-and-rstudio)
episode of the [Introduction to data analysis with R and Bioconductor](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/bioc-intro) lesson.

Additionally, you will also need to install the following packages that will be used throughout the lesson.

```r
install.packages(c("BiocManager", "remotes"))
BiocManager::install(c("tidyverse", "SummarizedExperiment",
                       "ExploreModelMatrix", "AnnotationDbi", "org.Hs.eg.db", 
                       "org.Mm.eg.db", "csoneson/ConfoundingExplorer",
                       "DESeq2", "vsn", "ComplexHeatmap", "hgu95av2.db",
                       "RColorBrewer", "hexbin", "cowplot", "iSEE",
                       "clusterProfiler", "enrichplot", "kableExtra",
                       "msigdbr", "gplots", "ggplot2", "simplifyEnrichment",
                       "apeglm", "microbenchmark", "Biostrings",
                       "SingleCellExperiment"))

```

_If you are attending a workshop, please complete all of the above before the workshop. Should you need help, an instructor will be available 30 minutes before the workshop commences to assist._
